# cpg-transformer
The Transformer is a  data transformer to convert metadata from external models
 and make it compatible for loading into the DSS

Currently the loader is only designed to handle output coming from the 
[Sheepdog Exporter](https://github.com/david4096/sheepdog-exporter/) exporting Topmed Public data from Gen3.

## Setup
For setup instructions, follow [the instructions for the loader](../README.md)

## Running Tests
Tests are run when the loader tests are run. See the Loader [instructions](../README.md).
